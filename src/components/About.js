                        I am a fun and friendly web developer with a background in customer service and hospitality. Helping people is what motivates me to go work.
                            Iâ€™ve provided technical support both in-person and remotely for iOS and Mac devices which provided the opportunity to use technical knowledge to help others.
                            I have also worked for 8 years as both a server and bartender which helped me develop strong relationship and problem-solving skills.
                            I look forward to growing in the tech industry, building some cool projects, and having a little fun along the way!
